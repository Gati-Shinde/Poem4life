        <h1> Poem for life to welcome you</h1>

        <p> He is dead <br>
        She is in jail <br>
    What went wrong? <br>
Where did they fail? <br> </p>

<p> They both were middle class <br>
In A way they were the same <br>
Bright and intelligent <br>
Just looking for money and fame <br> </p>

<p>They just choose the wrong set <br>
Of people around them <br>
Totally unaware of that <br>
It could lead to mayhem <br> </p>

<p>The glitz mislead them <br>
The 'Friends' were all fake <br>
Dope and substance abuse <br>
All for 'keeping up' sake <br> </p>

<p>The big guys out there <br>
Having parties and fun <br>
Who cares if families are broken <br>
They are safe, they dont have to run <br> </p>

<p> So maybe you should tell your kids <br>
To dream and dream high <br>
But make sure to check their own parachutes <br> 
Before they take off to sky <br> </p>
